# Drone Video Modalities

## 🔥 Infrared Video
> 📁 Location: `./Infrared video`

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics
- **⏱️ Temporal Processing**:  
  Videos are temporally downsampled with a **5-second interval** between consecutive frames to enhance wildfire progression visualization.
  
- **✅ Advantages over Visible Light**:
  - 🛡️ Resistant to smoke occlusion
  - 🌿 Unaffected by vegetation cover interference
  - 🔥 Clear thermal signatures of active fire fronts
  - 🌙 Effective for night operations and low-visibility conditions

### 🔬Scientific Value
Infrared imaging captures critical thermal dynamics that are essential for:
1. Accurate fire intensity mapping
2. Subsurface fire detection
3. Heat flux quantification
4. Burn severity assessment
