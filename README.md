### üî¨ Physical Model
- **WRF-SFIRE**: Weather Research and Forecasting model with the SFIRE module for coupled atmosphere‚Äìwildland fire simulation.


### üìà Data-driven Models
- **Earthformer**: Space‚Äìtime Transformer architecture tailored for Earth system forecasting.
- **PredRNN**: Recurrent neural network for spatiotemporal predictive learning.

### üé® Generative Models
- **MCVD**: Masked Conditional Video Diffusion for prediction, generation, and interpolation.
- **STDiff**: Spatio-temporal diffusion model for continuous stochastic video prediction.
- **VDT**: General-purpose video diffusion transformers via mask modeling.
- **DynamiCrafter**: Animating open-domain images with video diffusion priors.

### üî• FiReDiff Paradigm
**Enhanced wildfire-specific versions**: MCVD*, STDiff*, VDT*, DynamiCrafter*.
1. **Video Prediction**  
   ‚Ä¢ Run the chosen **generative model** on the infrared video modality to predict future frames.  
2. **Fire Mask Segmentation**  
   ‚Ä¢ Apply **SAM2** to the generated frames to produce accurate fire segmentation masks.  

> üí° **Note:** The ‚Äú*‚Äù denotes models fine-tuned under the FiReDiff paradigm for optimal wildfire forecasting performance.

### üìä Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate:
- **Segmentation Quality**: AUPRC, F1-score, IoU, and MSE  
- **Video Generation Quality**: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FVD
